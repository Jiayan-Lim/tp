# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 installed in your Computer.
   * [Installing Java 11 on Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-371F38CC-248F-49EC-BB9C-C37FC89E52A0)
     * To install Java 11 on Window, you have to first <span style="color:pink">download the jdk installer</span> and then <span style="color:pink">run the jdk installer</span> to install Java 11.
     * Step 1: To download jdk installer, click on the link above and scroll down to `Downloading the JDK installer` section:

     * Step 2: Click on the `Java SE Downloads` link, which leads you to this page:
       * ![](images/UGscreenshots/installer_oracle_home.png)
     * Step 3: Scroll down to this section, then, click on the `Java 11` tab in the top left corner:
       * ![](images/UGscreenshots/java11_installer_oracle.png)

   * [Installing Java 11 on macOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html)
     * Scroll down to `Installing JDK on macOS` and simply follow the instructions there!
       * ![](images/UGscreenshots/jdk_macOS.png)
2. Download the latest `careflow.jar` jar file from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp).

3. Copy the jar file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your careflowBook. For instance, you can create a folder `CareFlow` on your desktop and put the jar file inside.

4. Open a `command terminal`
   * For macOS:
     * Click on the `spotlight search` icon in the top right corner of your navigation bar, you'll see a search bar popping out.
       * <img src="images/UGscreenshots/spotlight_search.png" style="zoom:25%">
     * Type `terminal.app` into the search bar, and simply hit `enter`
       * <img src="images/UGscreenshots/terminal.png">
     * You're now looking at the `command terminal`, good job!
       * ![](images/UGscreenshots/command_terminal.jpg)
   * For Windows:
     * _To Be Added_
5. Navigate into the folder you put the jar file in with the `cd` command
   * Suppose you have adopted the suggestion to put the jar file inside a folder called `CareFlow` on your desktop, you should type:`cd desktop/CareFlow` into your `command terminal` and hit `enter`.
   * For keen learners, you can take a look at the short video below to learn more about the `cd` command
     * For macOS: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZ9mk6D6pw">Change Directories in MacOS Terminal (cd command)</a>
     * For Windows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3XQpnQTy6Y">How to Use CD Command in CMD</a>
6. Type the `java -jar careflow.jar` command into your `command terminal` and hit `enter` to run the application. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
   * ![](images/UGscreenshots/careflow_home.png)
7. Type some command in the command box at the bottom and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:
   * `p list` : Lists all patients.

   * `d list` : Lists all drugs.

   * `add -n John Doe -ph 98765432 -em johnd@example.com -ad John Street, Block 123, #01-01 -dob 21-01-2000 -g male -ic T3871918C` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the patient records.

   * `p clear` : Deletes all patient records.

   * `d clear` : Deletes all drug records

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

#### Notes about command format:
* Words in UPPER CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
